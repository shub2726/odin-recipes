    <h4><em>Richness of Rice Pudding combined with the Lusciousness of Ripe Mangoes</em></h4>
    <p>Mango phirni entails cooking ground rice with milk, sugar, and aromatic spices such as cardamom and saffron. The mixture is simmered until it thicken to a creamy consistency.</p>
    <p>The amalgamation of creamy, fragrant phirni and succulent mangoes creates a delightful culinary flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Mango (ripe, juicy, sweet & non fibrous variety) puréed.</li>
        <li>500 ml full fat milk</li>
        <li>2.5 tbsp basmati rice soaked for an hour</li>
        <li>Dry Nuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Firstly, heat milk in a saucepan and bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and keep stirring. At first the phirni will turn a bit dilute. Keep working on low heat and stir constantly.</li>
        <li>Now add the mango purée and stir. The phirni must be thick and creamy. Should take around 3-5 minutes. Adjust the sweetness by adding more sugar if needed.</li>
